"Titanic AI" is a web application that uses artificial intelligence to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not. It analyzes factors like class, age, and gender to make predictions. The app offers various functions through its API, including signing up, managing accounts, adding voyages and tickets, creating reservations, and getting predictions. It ensures security with JWT-based authentication. Users interact with the app through API requests, and administrators can manage voyages and tickets. This demonstrates how AI can be used to analyze historical data and make predictions.
